# Lab 0 - Hello World

## Instructions

0. Clone your repository to your local machine using GitHub Desktop.
1. Open the *package.bluej* file in BlueJ.
2. Edit only the file *HelloWorld.java*.
3. Edit the JavaDoc with your name and the date.
4. Add a **println** statement in the main method to print out "Hello World!".
5. Compile your code (this saves it to your local machine, also).
6. Run your code and check the result.
7. Run the jUnit tests.  Make sure your code passes all the tests.
8. Run checkstyle on your code.  Make sure there are no errors.
9. Commit your changes using GitHub Desktop.
10. Push your changes to GitHub (sync).
11. Edit the first line of the *Readme.md* file and replace both instances of "username" with your GitHub username.

## Grading
A typical lab will be graded as follows, though each lab will have grading expectations in the Readme.md.
* Passes all tests - 90%
* No checkstyle errors - 10%

Note that these are potential maximums; the computer can only check so much.  If your code passes checkstyle, but I see non-descriptive variable names, then your style grade will go down.  If your code passes all tests, but I see code that was copied off of the internet or from another student your grade will go *way* down.
